 -  Scalable: Uses Java 7's NIO.2 Asynchronous Sockets API (Interface to Native IOCP)
 -  Fast: Native memory operations via NIO ByteBuffer 

"v1/v2" Object Oriented implementation that focuses on modularity and parsing the HTTP protocol

"Mini" simplified version attempting a simpler but less object-oriented implementation
